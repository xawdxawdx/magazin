# c sharp project milestone 2
This project containts models, containers, their views.

For all controllers there are auto-generated methods for CRUD and views.

We have some validations in this project, both on Client and Server sides by using several ways:
1) Attributes in models: [required], [remote]
2) Custom validation: PasswordError (we cannot set pass to 'xawdxawdx')
3) IValidatableObject: User model (we can't create another Danila)
